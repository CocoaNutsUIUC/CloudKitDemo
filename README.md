# CloudKit Tutorial

- This tutorial will teach you the most basic components of Apple's ***CloudKit***.
- We are going to build a simple photo app called **Nutstagram** that allows you to upload photos from Camera and store them in iCloud.
- Prerequisit: `UITableView` (We won't go over too much details on how UITableView works, you can check out our previous tutorials on it if needed)

### Starting a New Project

1. **Create a new Xcode project** by clicking on ***Create a new Xcode project*** in the Xcode Lunch windows
2. Select ***Single View Application***
3. Give the project a name, and click on ***Next***.![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.18.58 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.18.58 PM.png)
4. Click on ***Create***.

### CloudKit Overview

- "Why in the world would you ever want to use CloudKit?"

  - It’s simple. Everything is handled by Apple. You don’t have to download any library and the users don’t need to go through the sign-up/sign-in headaches.
  - It’s trustworthy (maybe?). Privacy and security are, again, handled by Apple.
  - It’s cost-free, until you reach a certain amount of data. Apple offers a good amount of storage for free, which means it's pretty useful for small apps without a lot of traffic.

- "Then why in the world would you not use CloudKit?"

  - Using iCloud means your users need an iCloud account and have to be signed in on  their devices to use your app, and that sucks for a lot of people!
  - It only works on Apple platforms, so goodbye Android integration.
  - It’s probably still not as good as AWS or your good-old homemade MySQL server.

- **CloudKit Structure**

  - iCloud is devided into several containners, there are 7 of them:
    - `CKContainer`: a sandbox that allows an application to do whatever it wants inside this box; it's the most outer layer of our structure.
    - `CKDatabase`: include a private and a public database; the pirvate database should be used to store user information and other sensitive data; in this toturial, we're only going to use the public database.
    - `CKRecord`: these are like objects or templates that allow you store different types of information under a single piece of data using a key-value pair system.
      - For now, you can save `NSString`, `NSNumber`, `NSData`, `NSDate`, `CLLocation`,`CKReference`, and `CKAsset` in a CKRecord.
    - `CKRecordZone`: records are organized and stored in these zones; you can have both default and cutom zones.
    - `CKRecordIdentifier`: these are unique labels for records.

- **Entitlement**

  - Unfortunately, you have to be enrolled in Apple's Developer Program in order to use CloudKit.
  - But that's okay. If you don't have a developer's account, just sign in using these:
    - ***username: sstevenshang@gmail.com***
    - ***password: CloudKitDemo2016***
      - Note: this step is very important, you must have a valid developer account to develop with CloudKit!
  - Note: the iCloud container's name should be `iCloud.come.<your domain>.CloudKitDemo`, if you are using my account, it should be `iCloud.come.sstevenshang.CloudKitDemo`
  - Enable CloudKit by clicking on the project, under ***Capabilities***, turn on ***iCloud*** and check out ***CloudKit*** under ***Services***:  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.48.30 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.48.30 PM.png)It should look like this.
  - Now you're ready to dive into CloudKit.

  ### CloudKit Dashboard

  - Go to https://icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard/ and log in using a valid developer's account (again, use *sstevenshang@gamil.com* is you don't have one)
  - As you can see, there are five sections:
    - **Schema**: this is where we store our ***Record Type***
    - **Public Data**: the database for public data; you can perform add, search, or other operations here.
    - **Private Data**: the database for private data
    - **Admin**: this provides the ability to configure dashboard permissions for your development team.
  - In this tutorial, we will create one Record Type called ***Post***
  - Go to ***Record Types*** under ***Schema***
  - Click on the little **"+"** sign, name it *"UserPost"*, and create two fields:
    1. field name *"Date"*, field type *String*
    2. field name *"Image"* with field type *Asset*
  - It should look something like this:  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.46.39 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.46.39 PM.png)Once this is done, you now have a template for the basic database structure of our app.

  ### Basic UI Setup 

  - Before we start, let's first hook together some UI for the display of photos and a button for uploading photos! 
  - Drag ***Navigation Bar*** and insert it on the top of our ***View Controller***, and double click to name it *"Today's Post*".![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.57.10 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 3.57.10 PM.png) 
  - Add the following three constraints on our ***Navegation Bar***! ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 5.26.38 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 5.26.38 PM.png)
  - Now add two ***Bar Button Item*** onto each side of our ***Navigation Bar*** like this: ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.02.14 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.02.14 PM.png)
  -  Click on the right ***Button*** and under the *attribute inspector*, select ***"Add"*** under ***System Item***. Similarly, do the same thing for the left ***Button*** and select ***"Refresh"*** under ***System Item***.  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.06.52 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.06.52 PM.png)The result should look like something like this.
  - Now insert a ***Table View***: ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.08.21 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.08.21 PM.png)and create the following four constrains: ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 5.28.25 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 5.28.25 PM.png)
  - Update your frames and it should look like this:![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 5.28.52 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 5.28.52 PM.png)
  - Now, insert a ***Table View Cell*** inside our ***Table View***, name it *"Post"*
  - You can make the ***Post*** cell a little bit higher so it's easier for us to arrange stuffs inside it (Don't worry, we're going to resize the row height in code):  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.12.36 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.12.36 PM.png)
  - Now insert a ***ImageView*** and a ***Label***:  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.15.07 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.15.07 PM.png)
  - Add the following constraints on ***Image view***: ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.16.13 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.16.13 PM.png)Note that we want the constraint ***Aspect Ratio*** because we want the photo to be a squere. However right now, the ratio if off, and we need to go to the ***size inspector*** to change it!  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.19.26 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.19.26 PM.png)Update the ***multiplier*** to *"1:1"*.
  - Add the following constraint on **Label**:  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.22.18 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.22.18 PM.png)
  - Okay, we have our basic UIs ready, now let's go create a new ***CocoaTouch Class*** file and name it ***PostTableViewCell*** under the subclass ***UITableViewCell***: ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.26.09 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.26.09 PM.png)
  - Next, go to our ***Main.storyboard***, click on our ***TableViewCell***. 
    - Under ***Identity inspector***, set ***Class*** to *"PostTableViewCell"*
    - Under ***Attribute inspector***, set ***Identifier*** to *"Post"* (**important**!)
  - Create the following IBOutlet in ***PostTableViewCell.swift*** by the name *"postImageView"* and *"dateLabel"*: ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.29.30 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.29.30 PM.png)(to create IBOutlet, control drag from the view to the class in the Assisstant Editor)
  - Go to ***Main.storyboard*** again, in the left side panel, control drag ***Table View*** to ***View Controller*** twice and check on ***dataSource*** and ***delegate***:![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.33.08 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.33.08 PM.png)
  - One last thing, create an IBOutlet for ***Table View*** in our ***ViewController.swift*** using the name *"tableView"*:  ![Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.35.47 PM](/Images/Screen Shot 2016-10-20 at 4.35.47 PM.png)
  - Good, now we are ready to start coding!

### The Code for UI

Go to ***ViewController.swfit*** and put 

```swift
    tableView.rowHeight = UITableViewAutomaticDimension
    tableView.estimatedRowHeight = 450
```
inside `viewDidLoad()`. This will tell the `tablewView` to resize tiself based on the content inside the cell. However, you must provide an estimate of how high the row'd be in order for it to work, and here we estimates it to be 450.
